# Testing assignment

## 🏗️ Project overview

This project represents a testing assignment for a Junior Frontend Developer role.
It simulates the creation of a modern and visually engaging website for an
**internation construction company**. The goal is to design and implement
a professional web page that highlights the company's services, showcases
its expertise and drives visitors all the way to the contact form.
Text is in the Slovak language because the assignment was.

## ✨ Features

This project features:

- Hero section: To engage the user to learn more about the company. I have implemented 2 different modes of the Hero section, a "playful" one and a "professional" one. When in development mode, there is a toggle in the bottom right corner of the page. Feel free to look at both of them.
- Services section: To display all services the company provides
- About Us section: To provide basic information about the company
- References section: To display the biggest projects of the company
- Contact section: For the user to reach out to the company
