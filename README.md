# Testing assignment

## 🏗️ Project overview

This project represents a testing assignment for a Junior Frontend Developer role.
It simulates the creation of a modern and visually engaging website for an 
**internation construction company**. The goal is to design and implement 
a professional web page that highlights the company's services, showcases 
its expertise and drives visitors all the way to the contact form.

## ✨ Features

This project features:
- Hero section: To engage the user to learn more about the company. I have implemented 2 different modes of the Hero section, a "playful" one and a "professional" one. When in development mode, there is a toggle in the bottom right corner of the page. Feel free to look at both of them.
- Services section: To display all services the company provides
- About Us section: To provide basic information about the company
- References section: To display the biggest projects of the company
- Contact section: For the user to reach out to the company
